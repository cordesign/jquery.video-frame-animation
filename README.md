jquery.video-frame-animation (v0.0.2)
=====================================

jQuery plugin for animating a video frame sequence based on scroll position


WIP
===

This plugin is still a work in progress. Use as-is and without any warranty.
Development contributions are welcome.


TODO's / Feature wish list
==========================

- decoupling from window scroll event -> implementing custom function
  listener that can define the 0-100% frames animation range in any
  way
- methods for playing the animation (back and forth) programmatically
- smoother transition to high resolution images
- implement events for: preloading, scrolling, scrolling finished, 
  high resolution image loaded, etc.
